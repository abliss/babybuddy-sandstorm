# Baby Buddy (Sandstorm app)

:exclamation: WORK IN PROGRESS :exclamation:

This is the source for the [Baby Buddy](https://github.com/babybuddy/babybuddy)
app for [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io/).

## Caveats

- Baby Buddy currently only supports setting the application time zone from an
environment variable. This cannot be achieved with the regular Sandstorm grain
workflow, so the timezone is locked to Etc/UTC.
